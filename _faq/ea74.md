question: I've configured my server to include CORS headers but they still aren't showing up. Why?
---

First check for any error messages in the server logs.

If that doesn't help, here are some common problems to check:

* Have you saved the config file?
* Is the config file in the right place?
* If you have multiple servers, have you changed the correct one?
* The server may need restarting. Make sure you restart the correct server.
* CORS may be configured for some requests but not the request you're attempting.
* Is the failing request a preflight `OPTIONS` request? Does your configuration handle that?
* Could a proxy or intermediary server be removing the headers?
* Check for typos in your config. e.g. Spelling (`allow` / `allowed`), plural vs singular (`headers` / `header`),
  case-sensitivity.
* If you're using an online tutorial, is it for a compatible version of the server and/or CORS plugin that you're using?

One trick that can be useful is to try changing something unrelated in the config file, see whether that works. The
idea is to confirm that the latest version of the config file is definitely being used. Even deliberately breaking the
config file so that the server won't start is enough to confirm that your changes are having an effect.
