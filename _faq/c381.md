question: CORS is annoying. Why can't I turn it off?
---

If the web were to be redesigned from scratch it might look very different. But that isn't going to happen. Instead
browsers have to do the best they can with the web we have today.

Web browsers have to protect their users from malicious sites. You may know that your site isn't malicious but a
browser doesn't know that.

For a cross-origin request the browser is trying to protect the other server from your site. It assumes that your site
could be malicious, so it wouldn't make sense to allow your site to disabled the security protection.

Perhaps you control both servers. As far as you're concerned they're both part of the same site. But the browser doesn't
know that, it just sees two different origins (servers) and has to treat them as totally separate.

Before CORS existed the *same-origin policy* just blocked cross-origin AJAX requests. Now that was *really* annoying. At
least with CORS the server can choose to allow the request.
