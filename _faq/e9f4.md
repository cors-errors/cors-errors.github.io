question: What is CORS?
---

CORS is an acronym. It stands for 'Cross-Origin Resource Sharing'.

If you are involved in creating, configuring or maintaining a website then you may need to know about CORS.

Web browsers have a security feature known as the *same-origin policy*. This policy prevents code on one website from
talking to a different website unless certain conditions are met.

Roughly speaking you can think of 'origin' as meaning 'website' or 'server'. So when we talk about 'same-origin' we mean
'same-website' or 'same-server'. To find out more about exactly how origin is defined see
{% include faq-link.html faq="b667" %}.

In short, CORS is a way to turn off this security feature to allow AJAX requests to a different site.

The site making the AJAX request can't just turn off security. That would be back-to-front. As far as the browser is
concerned that site might be malicious and can't be trusted. It is the server receiving the AJAX request that decides
whether to allow CORS.
