question: My request works fine in Postman/cURL/etc.. Why do I get a CORS error in the browser?
---

The *same-origin policy* is a security feature built into web browsers. It doesn't apply if you make requests using
tools such as Postman or cURL. Concepts such as 'same-origin' and 'cross-origin' don't even make sense in that context.
Same origin as what? There is no current page making the request, so there is no origin to compare.

Any CORS errors you see in the browser console are not generated by the server. At the network level the request
probably succeeded. The browser may well have received exactly the same response that you see with Postman or cURL. It's
the browser that performs the CORS checks and blocks access to the response in JavaScript if those checks fail.

The biggest difference between a browser and tools like Postman is the preflight `OPTIONS` request. As those tools don't
use CORS they aren't going to send a preflight request automatically. However, a preflight is just an HTTP request so it
is possible to send it manually instead:

* {% include faq-link.md faq="b6b0" %}
* {% include faq-link.md faq="c7f6" %}

Within the browser it's usually pretty clear from the error message whether it's the preflight request that's failing.
