question: My request works fine in Postman/cURL/etc.. Why do I get a CORS error in the browser?
---

The rules for making a CORS request only apply inside a web browser. Concepts such as 'same-origin' and 'cross-origin'
don't even make sense within tools such as Postman. Same origin as what? There is no current page making the request, so
there is no origin.

Using those tools can be useful for testing CORS requests but you'll need to ensure that you're sending requests that
are equivalent to those sent by the browser.
