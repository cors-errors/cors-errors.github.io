question: What does 'origin' mean?
---

Consider the following URL:

```
http://www.example.com:3456/path?query=text
```

The *origin* for this URL would be `http://www.example.com:3456`. It includes the *scheme*, *hostname* and *port*.

```
http://www.example.com:3456
```

```
<scheme> :// <hostname> [ : <port> ]
```

The port may be omitted if it is the default port for the scheme, so `80` for `http` or `443` for `https`.

When the browser makes a CORS request it will include the origin for the current page in the **Origin** request header.

In JavaScript you can access the current page's origin using `location.origin`.
