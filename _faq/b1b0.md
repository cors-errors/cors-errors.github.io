question: Why can't I access the response headers in my JavaScript code?
---

By default, only the following response headers are exposed to JavaScript code for a CORS request:

* Cache-Control
* Content-Language
* Content-Type
* Expires
* Last-Modified
* Pragma

These are known as the *CORS-safelisted response headers*.

The specification was recently changed to add `Content-Length` to the list of CORS-safelisted response headers. This has
been implemented in some browsers but at the time of writing it still isn't included in Firefox.

To expose other response headers you need to use `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`. See

for more information.
