question: Why can't I access the response headers in Chrome's developer tools?

When you try to access the headers via the *Network* tab of Chrome's developer tools you may see the warning:

```
Provisional headers are shown
```

Further, the context-menu for the request won't show the options to ***Copy request headers*** or
***Copy response headers***.

There are several possible causes for this warning, some of which are not directly related to CORS. It may just mean
that the request hasn't finished yet because the server is taking a long time to respond. It'll also be shown if you try
to access files directly off the file-system without using a web-server.

However, the most likely cause for a CORS request is that the preflight checks are failing. If the preflight `OPTIONS`
request fails then the main request won't even be attempted, so there are no headers to show. There should be a
corresponding error message in the browser's console.
