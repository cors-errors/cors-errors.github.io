message: The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header contains multiple values 'http://example.com, http://localhost:8080',
         but only one is allowed.
---

Many HTTP headers support multiple values separated by commas. `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` does not. It must either be
the special value `*` or an exact match for the `Origin` request header.

Usually the cause of this problem is that the header value is being set twice. If any header appears twice on the
response then the HTTP specification says it should be treated as equivalent to a single header that has the values
separated using a comma followed by a space. Browsers, proxies and some servers will often combined multiple headers in
this way.

So, for example, you would see the error above if the server returned the following headers:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:8080
```

When these headers reach the browser they will be combined to form:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com, http://localhost:8080
```

The underlying cause for this problem may be that the CORS headers are being added in multiple places. For example, it
may be that a CORS plugin has been added twice. Or perhaps an intermediate web server is also configured to add the CORS
headers.

A particularly common version of this message is:

<blockquote class="error">
  The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header contains multiple values '*, *', but only one is allowed.
</blockquote>

It is very unlikely that the header was actually set to `*, *`. Much more likely is that it has been added twice:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

If you are making the request using the `fetch` API then you'll also see the following text at the end of the error
message:

<blockquote class="error">
  Have the server send the header with a valid value, or, if an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's
  mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
</blockquote>

For more information about opaque responses see {% include faq-link.md faq="dfdb" %}. Using an opaque response will
suppress the error message but it won't allow you to access the response details.
