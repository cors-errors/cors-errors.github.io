message: Method PUT is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Methods in preflight response.
---

Any cross-origin request that uses a method other than `GET`, `HEAD` or `POST` will trigger a preflight request. The
error message above refers to a `PUT` request but an equivalent message would be shown for other methods, such as
`DELETE`.

The browser will automatically include a request header in the preflight request called `Access-Control-Request-Method`.
The value specifies the method of the original request, e.g. `Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT`.

The server is expected to respond with a comma-separated list of acceptable request methods in the response header
`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`. If the method in `Access-Control-Request-Method` is not included in that list it will
trigger the error above.

Even when using the request methods `GET`, `HEAD` or `POST` a preflight can be triggered if there are custom request
headers. In that case the browser will still include the `Access-Control-Request-Method` request header but the
`Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header will be ignored.

A value of `*` can also be used as a wildcard in `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`. However, this is not allowed when using
`withCredentials` and will result in the same error message.

If you are unclear what a preflight `OPTIONS` request is then see {% include faq-link.md faq="b7f6" %}.
