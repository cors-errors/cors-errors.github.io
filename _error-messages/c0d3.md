message: "Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https."

**Quick fix:** Make sure you've included the `http://` or `https://` at the start of the request URL.

The first part of a URI, prior to the colon, is known as the *scheme*. Some examples include:

```
https://www.google.com        -> https
file:///home/user/picture.png -> file
mailto:webmaster@example.com  -> mailto
javascript:return false;      -> javascript
```

Cross-origin requests can only be made to URIs with certain schemes, as indicated in the error message. For example,
trying to access a file on the local filesystem using the `file` scheme is not allowed.

A common mistake is trying to use a URI of the form `localhost:3000/api`. The problem is that it doesn't include the
`http://` or `https://` prefix, so `localhost` is parsed as 'the bit before the colon', i.e. the scheme.

The *Network* tab of Chrome's developer tools will not show requests that trigger this error.
