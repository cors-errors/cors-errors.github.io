message: "Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: The value of the
         'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' header in the response is '' which must be 'true' when the request's
         credentials mode is 'include'."

If the request is made using `XMLHttpRequest`, as opposed to `fetch`, then there'll be an extra line at the end of this
error:

<blockquote class="error">
  The credentials mode of requests initiated by the XMLHttpRequest is controlled by the withCredentials attribute.
</blockquote>

For requests that use `withCredentials` the server response to the preflight `OPTIONS` request must include the header
`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` set to the value `true`. The same header must also be included for the main request,
though omitting it would trigger {% include error-link.html message="bbd3" text="a different error message" %}.

If you are unclear what a preflight `OPTIONS` request is then see {% include faq-link.html faq="b7f6" %}.

If the message reports a value of `''` then that usually means the header is missing altogether rather than being
returned with an explicit empty value.

If the error message indicates that the current value is `'true, true'` then that suggests that the header is being
returned twice.

See also {% include faq-link.html faq="fcd5" %}.
