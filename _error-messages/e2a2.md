message: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

This error indicates that the server response did not include the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.

This is very similar to {% include error-link.md message="b78f" text="another error message" %}. That error relates to
the preflight `OPTIONS` request, whereas this error specifically concerns the main request.

If you're new to CORS see {% include faq-link.md faq="e9f4" %} for more information.
