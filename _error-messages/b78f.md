message: "Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is
         present on the requested resource."
---

This error indicates that the preflight `OPTIONS` request failed because the server did not include the response header
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.

This is very similar to {% include error-link.html message="e2a2" text="another error message" %}. That error relates to
the main request, whereas this error specifically concerns the preflight `OPTIONS` request.

If you're new to CORS see {% include faq-link.html faq="e9f4" %} for more information.

If you are unclear what a preflight `OPTIONS` request is then see {% include faq-link.html faq="b7f6" %}.

If you've attempted to configure the CORS headers but you're still seeing this message then try
{% include faq-link.html faq="ea74" %}.

If you are making the request using the `fetch` API then you'll also see the following text at the end of the error
message:

<blockquote class="error">
  If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
</blockquote>

For more information about opaque responses see {% include faq-link.html faq="dfdb" %}. Using an opaque response will
suppress the error message but it won't allow you to access the response details.
