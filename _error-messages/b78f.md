message: "Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is
         present on the requested resource."
---

This error indicates that the preflight `OPTIONS` request failed because the server did not include the response header
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.

If you're new to CORS see {% include faq-link.md faq="e9f4" %} for more information.

If you are unclear what a preflight `OPTIONS` request is then see {% include faq-link.md faq="b7f6" %}.

This is very similar to {% include error-link.md message="e2a2" text="another error message" %}. That error relates to
the main request, whereas this error specifically concerns the preflight `OPTIONS` request.
